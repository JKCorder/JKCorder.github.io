While the role of foreign banks in emerging and developing economies has attracted the attention of policymakers and academics, reports that the Federal Reserve channeled billions in loans to foreign banks generated national news headlines in 2011 and triggered a (brief) push for greater scrutiny of foreign banks in the United States. What accounts for major changes in U.S. regulation of foreign banks? How have these rules changed as anxiety about financial crisis has been replaced with an appetite for global capital? What can the US case tell us more generally how internationally active banks impact and are impacted by domestic politics? The only conditions that seem to favor regulatory scrutiny are a rare combination of crisis or scandal (high public attention), outflows of capital from US markets, and a broader government commitment to regulatory reform.\r\nClick here to read the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We adopt a two-step process to isolate the effect of politics. First, we measure the number of days between the date that state-level cases first exceeded one case per 100,000 population and state issuance of a SIPO. This permits us to compare governor’s choices in similar contexts – when the disease is known to be present in the community. Second, we use a statistical tool – survival analysis – to differentiate between state characteristics that might be associated with higher risks of uncontrolled spread and the impact of political party control. We find that the timing of disease progression was remarkably similar across states, suggesting that many states reached the 1:100,000 benchmark at about the same time. By contrast, we find that, even after controlling for a variety of factors, a Republican governor coupled with a Republican majority in the state senate predicts delays in the implementation of SIPOs – delays on the order of two days for Republican states that did act, but no action by more than one-third of those states after more than two months above 1:100,000. In contrast, potentially important decision-making factors such as urbanization, elderly population, hospital beds, extent of chronic diseases, and budget capacity of the state government serve, at best, as poor predictors of SIPO timing.\r\nClick here to read the article.\r\nClick here for replication data and details\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In the words of journalist Frederick Lew Allen in 1931: “[The American woman] won the suffrage in 1920. She seemed, it is true, to be very little interested in it once she had it; she voted, but mostly as the unregenerate men about her did.”\r\nAllen had the facts right: Women did not initially take up their right to vote in the same numbers as men. When women did vote, their choices were little different from those of long-enfranchised men, a pattern many attributed to husbands telling their wives how to vote. Most of the more ambitious promises and warnings about women’s suffrage—both utopia and apocalypse—never materialized.\r\nOne hundred years later, we know a lot more about how women actually vote. Women are now more likely to turn out to vote than men. While husbands and wives still generally vote for the same candidates, few assume women take direction from their husbands. In fact, the most popular and persistent media narrative is that women are different; in particular, more likely than to favor Democratic candidates. Given these (new) facts and the longer view, how should we evaluate the impact of the 19th Amendment? What did the 19th Amendment do?\r\nClick here to read the essay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The Nineteenth Amendment states that “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” The amendment gives Congress the power to enforce the law by appropriate legislation. It does not, however, empower or charge any government office or actor with ensuring that women can and do cast ballots. This article argues that this reality, often taken for granted, has serious implications for both the incorporation of women into the electorate and the representation of their political interests.\r\nClick here to check out the article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

How have popular understandings of women as voters both persisted and changed over time? In A Century of Votes for Women, Christina Wolbrecht and J. Kevin Corder offer an unprecedented account of women voters in American politics over the last ten decades. Bringing together new and existing data, the book provides unique insight into women’s (and men’s) voting behavior, and traces how women’s turnout and vote choice evolved across a century of enormous transformation overall and for women in particular. Wolbrecht and Corder show that there is no such thing as ‘the woman voter’; instead they reveal considerable variation in how different groups of women voted in response to changing political, social, and economic realities. The book also demonstrates how assumptions about women as voters influenced politicians, the press, and scholars.\r\nClick here for details…\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The incorporation of women as full equals in the electoral process would take decades, and understanding why this is the case helps us better understand the challenges facing efforts to make voting rights a reality for traditionally marginalized groups.\r\nClick here to check out the essay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Some scholars anticipated that newly-enfranchised women—lacking political interest and experience—would be volatile and highly responsive to context.

We test these competing predictions with a Bayesian approach to ecological inference and a unique set of aggregate data. We find that the responsiveness of women’s turnout is strikingly similar to that of men. However, the lesser impact of electoral competition, and the greater effect of electoral laws and prior suffrage activism, suggest that the experience of and response to disenfranchisement shaped women’s turnout after the vote was won.\r\nClick here to read the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
