Check out my book with Christina Wolbrecht. We examine the voting behavior of newly enfranchised women in the first five presidential elections after the 1920 ratification of the 19th amendment. While new women voters don't change the overall or national relative strength of the two major parties, we find that women enter the electorate as local partisans, making one party GOP states more Republican and one party Democratic states more Democratic. New women voters contribute to the diminishing vote share of third party alternatives after 1924.
