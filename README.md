This is a landing page to link to the book folders for my open source texts

The site was updated and refreshed in August, 2025

Fixed an error in Chapter 3 in Februry, 2026

The site was construced using the distill R package

The nojekyll file in the docs folder means this a static website - so only static html files for each chapter plus content in data and images folders
and json file for search bar.  All .md files and other files except readme deleted in August 2025.
