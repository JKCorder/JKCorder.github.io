This is a landing page to link to the book folders for my open source texts

The site was updated and refreshed in August, 2024

The site was construced using the distill R package

The nojekyll file in the docs folder means this a static website - so only static html files for each chapter plus content in data and images folders
All .md files and other files except readme deleted in August 2025
