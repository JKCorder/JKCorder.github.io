I teach courses in US government and politics, as well as methods courses. This blog profiles my work on banking, women and politics, and public policy. This site contains posts about my research and links to open source textbooks that I have developed for my undergraduate and graduate data analysis courses. You can also navigate to my replication data at the Harvard Dataverse. This site was created with the R distill package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
