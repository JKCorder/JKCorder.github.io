<p>More and more information is stored electronically. Data are “captured electronically in the first instance” Ayers example points out the costs and challenges of data collection – site visits, paper forms, data entry. Example: interest rate discrimination in new car purchases – data set of three million auto loan transactions – recoding name and other features captured by the lender, merged with CA driver’s license data that includes Social Security Number and race. This digital data is now a commodity. And data is frequently stored in ways that permit easy access…

Clinton administration initiatives (GPRA) and Bush administration efforts culminated in the PART. So why didn’t things improve faster? What was missing? We need more high quality evidence.

<p>If data are available, there are still 3 important constraints:
- statistical knowledge: “core regression and randomization techniques” are well-established
- computational power: Computing power has not been a problem for decades
- storage: storage was a limit (compare $50 for a 1TB drive today vs $400 in the book c. 2008)</p>

<p>Research design – data-driven decision-making is an alternative driven by responding to anecdotes, complaints, or good ideas.</p>
<p>The research design process – background, problem, theory, research question, hypothesis, operationalization, methods, evaluate the data.</p>
<p>One insight from this is that research tends to be problem-driven – you are searching for a solution. (Streets are flooding more often, crime is up, complaints about park maintenance are up).</p>
<p>Another insight is that we rely on models – a simple representation of outcomes and causes (appeals informally to ideas of covariance or correlation).</p>
<p>The combination of problem statement, theory, and research question should lead you to a specific empirical claim that you can test – wider roads have increased storm-water runoff.
To test these specific empirical questions – we need data – how do we measure the individual components, can we exploit existing data to answer this question?</p>

<p>What is Moneyball?</p>
<p>Unbiased, unemotional, mechanical (what is a neural network)</p>
<p>Models - dispassionate In determining how a marketing strategy works, a policy works, or a partnership lasts? Or how much movie a money will earn.</p>
<p>Why are human beings bad at making predictions?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>too much weight to unusual events</p></li>
<li><p>selective acceptance or attention to disconfirming evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>overconfident in predictive accuracy</p></li>
<li><p>…and all of these get worse as problems get more complicated</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(For Ayers, a stark contrast to equations – no emotional attachment, specific information about uncertainty)</p>
<p>Why not blend human and machine? Human discretion at the end of the process wipes out gains from mechanical prediction Can’t judgement and data coexist?</p>
<p>Problem: judgment of the aided expert is somewhere between the unaided expert and the mechanical prediction. So the conclusion is that the machine/software should control the decision.</p>
<p>Example: parole decisions. Marked decline of expert decisions. RRASOR scores can trigger an involuntary indefinite civil commitment (movie analogy Minority Report). A Virginia statute mandates that the scores be used – narrowing the discretion of criminal justice experts. But even this limited discretion can lead to mistakes. What about the thresholds proposed in the text – if more than 10 percent of automatic choices are reversed, then there is a problem with the decisionmakers. Further, if more than half of the overrides are ultimately wrong, then overrides are too frequent even if only 5 percent. Example: decline of human component of parole decisions. VA statue that includes a RRASOR tripwire – mandating involuntary confinement of sexually violent criminal likely to repeat offend</p>

</h2>
<p>An argument: Paul Meehl on clinical versus statistical prediction. Meehl distinguishes informal or non-mechanical judgments from formal or mechanical or statistical – also labeled actuarial- predictions. The latter require no professional judgements.</p>
<p>The basic question is whether exposure to some treatment will produce a benefit or generate a cost. For example…. “if a four-variable regression equation or. . . actuarial table tells the criminal court judge that this particular delinquent will probably commit another felony in the next 3 years and if a case conference or a social worker says he will probably not . . . the plain fact is that [the judge] cannot act in accordance with both of these incompatible predictions.”</p>
<p>Meehl argues that in an overwhelming majority of cases, the mechanical prediction will be superior. And others reach similar conclusions. “As long as you have some history and some quantifiable data form past experiences” …the regression will win.</p>

<p>egal scholars vs political scientists. Models are retrospective – but can they predict future behavior? The political science team used a simple model - only six factors.</p>
<p>The political science model outperformed the legal scholars expert. But there was expert judgement (human intervention) in at least two ways – determining the elements of the model and “coding” the cases – capturing the measures that may be somewhat subjective. (Ayers makes much of the fact that discretion is “channeled” to these narrower functions.)</p>

</h3>
<p>What is the performance management movement and how is that different from Moneyball for Government? (Moneyball emphasizes statistical models and experiments, performance management is more narrowly data or measurement)</p>
<p>Exploiting performance measures, an example: Accurate and timely intelligence, rapid deployment, effective tactics, relentless follow-up – the four principles behind CompStat, a “major innovation in American policing” that led to a citywide implementation of performance indicators in Baltimore CitiStat and spilled over into Rudi Guilliani’s vision of more nimble federal government. At its core, CompStat is a leadership strategy.</p>
<p>Collecting the data. The search for data is driven by two needs – analytical and motivational – what can we analyze? How can we motivate people to embrace improvements? The availability of data varies widely – police produce reports – collect data – routinely. In other agencies, performance measure are more obscure or difficult and expensive to record. But even the police department may not analyze data daily or even weekly. All organizations keep at least two forms of data – internal administrative and external reporting data. So that is a start.</p>
<p>The Moneyball comparison might not be appropriate – in baseball, the purpose is clear: win games and the rules are specific, enforced and rarely subject to change. Neither describes government. How do you craft a meaningful metric that is “correlated with the organization’s purpose and relatively easy to obtain?” (Robert Behn describes the hazard of maximizing performance on metrics that do not capture the organization’s mission – and related problems of corruption and distortion – the “Campbell effect”)</p>
<p>Dials, Tin Openers and Alarm bells. Performance indicators can be prescriptive, descriptive, and proscriptive (requiring immediate action to stop some behavior). Robert Behn claims most performance metrics are tin openers “opening a can of worms” that might suggest a performance deficit exists.</p>
<p>Inputs, outputs, outcomes. Outcomes data suffer from two problems – they are rarely timely (decades to fruition) and they are difficult to attribute (other factors can generate changes in the metric). “Output data is timely and controllable substitute” (Note that this is another difference between performance management and Moneyball approaches)</p>
<p>Performance measurement is the first step in performance management.</p>
<p>Learning by asking questions. How are we performing? What is working? What are our deficits? What innovations are possible? This is the core of performance management but only the starting point for evidence-based management.</p>

<p>One proposal from Money ball is to follow the lead of business to create low cost high impact interventions (like the Google marketing strategies) – test a change in procedure in random sample of program participants,</p>
<p>One example: specific successes of the Nurse Family Partnership (3 site randomized trials with women diverted to NFP onsite program or offered opportunities for screening and treatment referral – among the findings, from the Denver site, “3.6% of nurse-visited children scored in the borderline or clinical range for internalizing problems, such as depression and anxiety, versus 8.2% of control-group children. This difference was statistically significant at the 0.10 level, but not the 0.05 level.).”</p>
<p>For the authors, evidence-based governance is an fiscal, economic and moral imperative – use limited resources to close the achievement gap between low and high SES children.</p>

<p>A moneyball index. (Congress has apparently adopted top tier evidence guidelines – see toptierevidence.org and GAO report number GAO-10-30 entitled ‘Program Evaluation: A Variety of Rigorous Methods Can Help Identify Effective Interventions’ which was released on November 23, 2009. Specific language in a 2007 HHS authorization: “ensure that states use the funds to support [home visiting program] models that have been shown, in well-designed randomized controlled trials, to produce sizeable, sustained effects on important child outcomes, such as abuse and neglect.) But the authors caution we should think continuum not on/off - don’t simply sort programs keep or kill, but use the data to improve performance.<br>
Another idea is to build a clearinghouse to share results (see evidencebasedprograms.org) Search “Postsecondary” at <a href="http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/" class="uri">http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/</a>)</p>
<p>The Commission proposed funding and Chief Evaluation Officers for departments and programs. This is consistent with the Moneyball prescription to divert 1% of all program funding to evaluation.</p>
<p>This suggests a new objective for a graduate PA or PSCI methods course: a primary objective of the course is to enable you to (1) determine when it might make sense to undertake some form of statistical analysis, (2) determine if a consultant might be required and how to evaluate consulting proposals, and (3) to evaluate and understand products a statistical consultant might produce.</p>
