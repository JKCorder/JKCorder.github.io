I am a professor of political science at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo.  My research has appeared in the *American Political Science Review*, *The Journal of Politics*, and other outlets in political science and public administration. Much of my work focuses on economic policy, including two books on the Federal Reserve System. In 2013, I received a Fulbright–Schuman European Affairs program grant to study the regulation of banks in Malta and the United Kingdom. I shared a National Science Foundation grant and the Carrie Chapman Catt prize with Christina Wolbrecht, University of Notre Dame.  We co-authored **Counting Women’s Ballots: Female Voters from Suffrage through the New Deal** and **A Century of Votes for Women: American Elections since Suffrage** (both Cambridge University Press).

I teach undergraduate and graduate course in quantitative methods and I am working on open source texts for each class.
