<p>In many research situations, the variables of interest are both some type of scale - either an interval or an ordinal variable. This would include concrete measures like household income, year of education, or age, and concepts that we order in a meaningful way – like ideology (from extreme liberal to extreme conservative) or party identification (from strong Democrat to strong Republican) or a feeling thermometer (from 0 – don’t like it – to 100- really like it). If you are interested in determining the relationship between two variables that are scales, then you should calculate and use the correlation coefficient.</p>
<div id="what-is-correlation" class="section level2" number="8.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> What is correlation?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-correlation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Correlation is a measure of association appropriate for interval level variables (and can be applied to ordinal variables that are “approximately interval” e.g. party id or ideology). The test statistic ranges from -1 to +1 and gives you a one-number summary of the direction and size of the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>If two variables have a correlation of +1 or -1, then they are perfectly correlated. If correlation is greater than 0, then the variables are described as positively related or directly related. If correlation is less than 0, then the variables are described as negatively related or inversely related. As the correlation moves away from zero (closer to +1 or -1), the stronger the link between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. A correlation of zero is a null relationship. Negative does not mean null. Null is zero. To give you a sense how numbers translate into data, the figures below show hypothetical samples wth different levels of correlation.</p>

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="03-corr_files/figure-html/example-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>You can always describe your expectations using these numbers. For example, you would expect to observe that as the education level of a respondent increased, income would also increase. Income should be positively correlated with education. Maybe something in between what we observe above for 0.2 and 0.6?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="computation" class="section level2" number="8.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Computation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#computation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Computation of the correlation coefficient requires that we compute the covariance of two variables and the standard deviation of each variable.</p>
<p>Recall that standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>is simply the square root of the sample variance.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sigma_x = \sqrt{\frac{( \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu)^2}{n-1}}\]</span></p>
<p>We compare every individual value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to the group mean. If many people are higher or lower than the mean, we see that the variance and standard deviation are high. If many people are close to or equal to the group mean, we see that the variance and the standard deviation are low.</p>
<p>The building block for correlation is the covariance and it follows the same logic as the variance. We compare very individual of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to the mean of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and multiply that by same individual’s value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> minus the mean of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. If people who have high values of, for example, income also have high values of party id then that implies a positive covariance. If people who are low income are low on the party id scale that also implies a positive covariance.</p>
<p>In symbols, the covariance is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
cov(x,y)= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu)^2 (Y_i - \mu)^2}{n-1}
\]</span></p>
<p>Once we know the covariance between the two variables and the standard deviation for each variable, we can calculate the correlation. The sample correlation coefficient (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>) is, in words, the covariance between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> divided by the standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In symbols:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\rho=\frac{cov(X,Y)} {\sigma_x\sigma_y}
\]</span></p>
<p>This number (the correlation) can never be large than 1.0 and never be smaller than -1.0. The farther the number is from zero, the larger the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>

<p>Three important cautions about correlation.</p>
<div id="correlation-is-most-useful-as-a-relative-measure" class="section level3" number="8.3.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.3.1</span> Correlation is most useful as a relative measure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#correlation-is-most-useful-as-a-relative-measure"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>First, correlation is best used as a description of the direction and relative size of the relationship (i.e. a correlation of .8 is a stronger correlation than a correlation of .5). It is less useful as an absolute measure. A correlation of 0.5 without knowing the type of dataset, variables, or other correlations in the sample would not be very helpful to understand what is important or what is a weak predictor.</p>
</div>
<div id="correlation-assumes-a-linear-relationship" class="section level3" number="8.3.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.3.2</span> Correlation assumes a linear relationship<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#correlation-assumes-a-linear-relationship"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Second, statements about correlation also assume that the relationship between two variables is linear (or approximately linear). Nonlinear relationships may not be reflected in correlation.</p>
<p>For instance, we could not test the link between party id and attention to politics with a correlation coefficient. This would not work since strong Republicans and strong Democrats are both likely to pay attention to campaigns, while Independents are not likely to pay attention – the relationship between party id and attention is U-shaped or nonlinear.</p>
<div id="figure-5.-example-of-a-u-shaped-relationship.-partisanship-and-interest-in-politics" class="section level4" number="8.3.2.1">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">8.3.2.1</span> Figure 5. Example of a U-shaped relationship. Partisanship and interest in politics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#figure-5.-example-of-a-u-shaped-relationship.-partisanship-and-interest-in-politics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="03-corr_files/figure-html/figure7-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>Notice, again, that leaners are more likely strong partisans - very interested in politics compared to weak partisans. The interest scale goes from 1 to 4 and 3.0 indicates that someone follows politics “Fairly closely.” The blue span is the best-fitting curve.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="correlation-doesnt-work-for-arbitrary-categories" class="section level3" number="8.3.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.3.3</span> Correlation doesn’t work for arbitrary categories<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#correlation-doesnt-work-for-arbitrary-categories"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Finally, never use correlation if variables are not scales. Recall that we have access to a number of variables that are simply categories- race, religion, and region. We use a number to place people in categories. For the 2020 ANES religion variable, 1=mainline Protestant and 4=Roman Catholic. The numbers are meaningless in the sense that Catholics are not 4 times more anything than Protestants and we could just as easily used 1=Roman Catholic or 3=Roman Catholic.</p>
<p>Any time the order of the categories is arbitrary (race, marital status, employment status, region, religion), you should not use correlation since it will be misleading and uninformative. You will see an example of this on the final exam and you should be able to report that the correlation is meaningless. Almost everyone gets this question wrong on the exam!</p>

</h2>
<p>Most statistical software produces correlations in the form of a matrix. Table 3.2 reproduces output that summarizes the link between education and income. We just need to focus one number for now the Pearson correlation at the top right corner.</p>
<div id="table-3.2-correlation-between-education-and-income" class="section level3" number="8.4.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.4.1</span> Table 3.2 Correlation between education and income<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#table-3.2-correlation-between-education-and-income"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<pre><code>          income education
income     1.000     0.369
education  0.369     1.000</code></pre>
<p>The correlation between income and education in this sample is 0.369. We can learn two things from this output. First, the link between income and education is positive, more years of education leads to higher average income. Second, the link is not perfect – there are many poorly educated high income respondents and highly educated lower income respondents. As we expected, the actual correlation was between 0.2 and 0.6.</p>
<p>Note that the most useful way to use correlation is to compare the correlations between two pairs of variables from the same dataset. Table 3.3 treats ideology as our dependent variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and tests the link with two independent variables, education and income. The ideology scale is order from 1=extremely liberal to 7=extremely conservative – so this variable is ordinal – and higher means more conservative.</p>
</div>
<div id="table-3.3-correlation-between-ideology-party-id-education-and-income." class="section level3" number="8.4.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.4.2</span> Table 3.3 Correlation between ideology, party id, education, and income.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#table-3.3-correlation-between-ideology-party-id-education-and-income."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<pre><code>          ideology partyid income education
ideology     1.000   0.735 -0.005    -0.141
partyid      0.735   1.000  0.033    -0.112
income      -0.005   0.033  1.000     0.350
education   -0.141  -0.112  0.350     1.000</code></pre>
<p>This output is in the form of a correlation matrix – so you can see all three correlations – party vs. ideology, education vs. ideology, and income vs. ideology in one table. In this sample, the correlation between ideology and income is very close to zero (-0.005) – there is no relationship. The link between education and ideology is a bit stronger and negative (-0.141) – more education means a slightly lower ideology or more liberal. It would be safe to conclude that poorly educated respondents are the most conservative and highly educated are the most liberal. But party id is clearly the best predictor (0.735 - the fartherst of any of the correlations from zero). We can also see that education and income are more closely related to each other (0.350) than either are to ideology. The number in this table is slightly different than immediately above since a few observations were missing - meaning that a few respondents did not answer the ideology question.</p>
