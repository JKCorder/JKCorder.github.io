<img src="cover.png" class="cover" width="250" height="328"/>This text is the primary resource for **PSCI 3950, Data in Politics and Policy**. Rather than requiring a statistics text, this text combines all of the information you need in one document â€“ an introduction to statistics, an introduction to political behavior and a guide to interpreting statistical output. The organization is similar to the PowerPoint presentations on Elearning. This document is a work in progress, so let me know if you have ideas about organization or content or if you notice errors. I included links and references to a number of articles and other sources that students have uncovered for me. If you see interesting quantitative work online or in print, let me know.

The course is designed to acquaint you with the basic statistical techniques used by practicing social scientists, particularly a statistical model known as linear regression. Each chapter of this text covers about one week of material. The plan is for you to use this text as you work with the statistical output that you will use for the worksheets and papers.
